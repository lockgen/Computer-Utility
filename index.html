        Optimization
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="classicText">
        To begin with, I would like to express my appreciation for your decision to access this HTML document and for your willingness to learn about how you can optimize your computer. In my opinion, the most crucial aspect of this optimization process is to utilize the tool that I have mentioned in the README.txt file, which I hope you have read. The key point of that file, aside from referencing this website, is to highlight the importance of using this tool. Once you have opened the tool, navigate to the "Tweaks" tab and select the "Laptop" preset. While I would suggest keeping GameDVR and Run OOShutup enabled, it's up to you to decide which options you prefer. Hover over the different options and read the descriptions to get a better understanding of what each one does, so you can make informed choices about which features to enable or disable.

        Simple Utilities
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="classicText">
        A good start for some utilities is installing browsers. Firefox is a good one, but there are ones like LibreWolf, Chromium, Brave, Edge (yuck!), and Vivaldi. These all function pretty much the same, but of course each browser is different. Next we have the communications, like the IRC chat HexChat or the encrypted Telegram messenger. Do your own research and install whichever you feel is the best. Now we have the development section. It's unnecessary to have them unless you want to start developing programs and other things, but most don't need them. The document section has a decent amount of some pretty good programs, but one I personally recommend (and is possibly the best one listed) is Notepad++. It literally has everything, and for (goblins) developers it even understands different languages. It's overall a great addition to your system, and makes document editing so much easier. (.txt files, not .pdfs.) Next we have the Games section. If you aren't a person who plays games, then you wouldn't even need to know about this section, so don't worry about it. Pro tools and Microsoft tools are for more advanced users, but you can research each program and what they do if it's really that important. Next are the multimedia tools. I would recommend installing Kdenlive if you will be editing videos, Audacity for editing and recording audio, Greenshot for all of your screenshotting needs, GIMP for image editing, and VLC which you should DEFINITELY install. It's really good for playing media, and has a lot of options. Next we have the utilities. Totally would recommend installing qBittorent, Sandboxie (allows you to run programs in a sandbox), Rufus Imager (Better imaging experience), Either J Download Manager or Internet Download Manager (IDM), but IDM is only free for 30 days. That's pretty much it for any programs you may need to install!

        Configurations & Updates
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="classicText">
        This one will be pretty quick, there's not much to go over. In the "Config" tab, there are 5 options you can pick, aside from the 10 other buttons. All .Net frameworks installs the .Net frameworks provided by Microsoft for the functionality of some programs to work, HyperV visualization (i have no idea what the HELL that does...), Legacy Media just brings back old media players ( i think ), NFS does something idk, and Windows Subsystem for linux makes a windows subsystem for linux. For the "Updates" tab, I would recommend using the Security settings, as this only installs security updates that have been rolled out by Windows.

        Passwords & Password Management
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="classicText">
        I can already think of a few people who are gonna need this. This is honestly one of the most important ones to understand. Having different passwords across different platforms should be obvious, but having complicated ones are very important. Having a password that looks like "aC71sSgSLAoP393:(du4\" is important because it can make it extremely difficult to get a hold of an account that has a difficult password. It's recommended you store the password in real life and on your computer, preferably somewhere in your files hidden that looks like it would fit in with other folders, or somewhere on your computer but it doesn't really matter if I'm being totally honest. What does matter, is naming each password. Instead of putting the name of the website the password is for, it's recommended that you make a nickname for that website or something across those lines so that you recognize what the password is associated with. Make sure the nickname is something obscure, it doesn't even have to be a real word. It just has to be something that only YOU will recognize. For example, let's say you have a password for gmail. Instead of just writing in what the password is for and then entering in the password in a text document, do it like this instead: <img src="/2023-03-09 13_48_54-obf.txt - Notepad.png"> (If image does not load, open it in the folder.) In this example, I used the first letter of the website I was using the password for, and then thought of another word that matches the websites first letter. Again, it doesn't even have to be an actual word, or have any letters relating to it at all. In fact, it could be anything associated with that password! All that matters, is that you recognize what the password is relating to.
